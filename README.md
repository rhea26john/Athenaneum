  If there is any omission, please point out as soon as possible.

  

  Potential problems:

  - Can we finish these in time? Which is non-essential?
  - Have we meet the requirements of the customer(assessment)?
  - How can we demonstrate our various skills rather than repeat an ability multiple times?
  - Do we remain Book tags?
  - Do we remain account settings? Allowing user to change email?
  - While adding a book, we need an upload field to upload the cover page of the book, and also the picture will be displayed in the book details page.

### Draft APIs

#### Module/Controller list

To divide and conquer the former functionalities, the following **7** controllers need to be build:

- IndexController
- UserController
- CategoryController
- BookController
- RecommendationController
- CommentController

Be aware that in MVC frameworks, the **controller class name** and **action method name** should conventionally ***be consistent with*** the request **route**.

#### IndexController

| Method name | route        | Description                            |
| ----------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| index       | /index/index | Display the index page of the web app. |

















#### UserController

| Method name | route          | Description                                                  | Data dependencies                                            |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| register    | /user/register | If the HTTP request type is **get**, display the registration form.<br />if the role is **Super admin**, display an additional **role selection** form element, otherwise, provide the username, password, email, etc. Consider save the role id in cookie as a basis.<br />If the HTTP request type is **post**, insert data into table, creating an account. While finished, redirect to /user/login. | User.uid<br />User.rid<br />User.username<br />User.password<br />User.OthersAsNeeded |
| login       | /user/login    | If the HTTP request type is **get**, display the login form.<br />If the HTTP request type is **post**, means the user submitted p&w, and intends to verify and get access. Receive the data and attempt to match a record in the User table. Once matched, respond a cookie to the browser to save a message(sessionID,rid) to mark/keep the login status. Consider cookie/session in Django. Once finished, redirect to /index/index. | User.username<br />User.password<br />User.sessionID<br />User.rid |





















#### CategoryController

| Method name | route            | Description                                                  | Data dependencies                    |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| add         | /category/add    | If the HTTP request type is **get**, display the add form.<br />If the HTTP request type is **post**, insert data into table, creating an category. <br />Maximum 2 level. (parentID=0 top level category, parentID!=0 second level category)<br />While finished, redirect to /category/list. | Cat.catId<br />Cat.name<br />Cat.pid |
| list        | /category/list   | Display all categories.                                      | Cat.catId<br />Cat.name              |
| edit        | /category/edit   | If the HTTP request type is **get**, display the edit form, load current data into form elements via v-model command. <br />If the HTTP request type is **post**, update data into table. <br />While finished, redirect to /category/list. | Cat.catId<br />Cat.name<br />Cat.pid |
| delete      | /category/delete | Once clicked, prompt a confirm dialog. <br />Once confirmed, send the category id to the server, and check the category whether has sub-categories. If so, show a warning message and terminate the deletion. If not, delete the cat by ID. <br />While finished, redirect to /category/list. | Cat.pid<br />Cat.catId               |

### Route access control

Be aware that the user can manually insert any request URL in the browser, or even make fake requests via curl/wget or other customized programs.

In one word, front-end route control is essential to prevent ordinary users from accidentally entering protected pages; also, back-end verifies are significant as well,  to deny malicious users.

| No.  | routes               | Requirements | Involve role-based check/visibility                          |

### Cyber security

Defence SQL injection and XSS attack in every insert function.





### Check point

Up to this point, all functionalities are checked as feasible.

If there is any omission, please feedback as soon as possible.











## Data schema

This chapter aims to summarize tables and attributes to ensure data schema is consistent with functionalities.

### Check point

Up to this point, all data schema are sufficient to support functionalities.

All relations are in BCNF except Book is violating 1NF (Book.catIds).

If you have a better design, please feel free to modify.



































## Process flow

Functional design must be feasible and consistent, otherwise, the project risk will increase.

We'd better clarify how our front pages organize function entrances (button, link, other interactive elements) to call the backend APIs.



In this chapter, I merely provide my personal, technical perspective design example as a basis for iteration. Please discuss in the teams to ask for clarify.





### Page example

![image-20230214075732095](./docsrc/image-20230214075732095.png)

















### Page summary

Not all functions correspond to a page. Many functions are just an API to provide data to be rendered. A page can call and render multiple APIs asynchronously. Please consider to avoid or reduce using template engine, they waste performance and outdated.



The following table specify weather a route provides a page:

Therefore, there are **13** HTLM pages need to be design.

























## Assessment review

1. We have a month, ideally 20h/person to build the app

   <img src="./docsrc/image-20230214081630951.png" alt="image-20230214081630951" style="zoom: 67%;" />

2. Some requirements are vague/out of plan

   <img src="./docsrc/image-20230214081945672.png" alt="image-20230214081945672" style="zoom: 67%;" />

   

   

   

3. Use the space wisely
